<!-- Semantic tags are used to differentiate between varying categories of information. They don't seem to have an effect on the actual rendering of the web page, but are important for other developers when they're reading your code, as well as for people using screen readers or other accessibility devices. 

I believe that the browser reads top to bottom when displaying code on a page. This is why it's important to double check opening and closing tags, to ensure that you're giving the browser properly formatted information for rendering.

I learned that Sublime has a cool snippet-creating feature. I also learned from my guide Davina that I can use cmd+/ to comment and uncomment lines of code. Handy! I probably won't create custom snippets for now, just so I can practice writing out the code on my own and retain the information better. I may use them in the future when the code I'm snippet-ing is really ingrained in my memory. 

I think the concept that was most challenging for me was knowing when to use each type of semantic tag. I like to think visually, but these tags don't really create visual differences. The distinction are more theoretical. I think I'll have this down with more practice and getting more comfortable thinking about information on a page in terms of blocks of meaning/structure.-->
