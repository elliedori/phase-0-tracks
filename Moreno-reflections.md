* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Git Merges and conflicts were still a bit foreign to me. I understood the concept but did not feel like I totally knew the practical application of it.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Branching. Ellie brought up a good question regarding branches that are created off of other feature branches. Katy clarified any merge will go back to the master branch no matter what the parent branch is.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Tips on shortcuts for Git commands. The most practical use of some of these for everyday use. 

* What still confuses you about Git?
I'd like to say not much! At this point what confuses is the commands I don't know so I'd like to explore other Git commands further.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Great! Ellie and I had a similar way of thinking so it was very smooth and easy to ask questions while completing the task at hand.
