# Learning JQuery: A Simple Plan

## Learning
* search for jquery cheat sheet, familiarize myself with syntax
* find a cool intro to jquery article or video, read/watch it
* find any relevant questions on stackoverflow, read through answers
* explore any links that might have been included in the stack overflow post

[20 min break: stretch, drink some water, go for a walk]

## Doing
* explain jquery in my own words as I would to a small child
* practice jquery syntax, write some statements and test them in console if possible
* come up with a small project I can use jquery with

## Reasoning

I chose this approach because it's separated into two distinct blocks, where I can really focus in and have uninterrupted work time. I learn best by looking at code examples, reading, and watching videos, so those are the resources I'll look for during the learning phase. Then, I have a longish break so I can give my brain a break and allow the information to absorb a little bit. After the break, I'll put what I've learned into practice.
