## First GPS Reflection

**1.** I felt pretty good about cloning a repo and pushing changes back up to Git. One thing that I felt unclear on was pulling changes *down* after the repo on Github had been updated. Luckily, we got a chance to practice just that during this pairing session.

**2.** I feel like we clarified how to use Github in its entirety. It also helped to review the full process of cloning a repo and creating a new feature branch.

**3.** I asked my guide about branch structures. We created a feature branch off an existing feature branch, and I asked whether you could merge a grandchild feature branch back into the master branch directly. (It turns out you can.) I asked my pair about clarification on pushing to Github from the master branch. We encountered an error while we were trying to push, but were able to resolve it by working together.

**4.** I understand Git pretty well now, and can work using the commands from memory. Sometimes, though, I forget to create a feature branch and start working on the master branch. I think at the this point it's just a matter of practicing the workflow so it becomes second nature.

**5.** My first experience was awesome. Laura and I both seemed pretty clear on Git and Github, and we were able to help each other along when the other person got stuck. She communicated really clearly and seemed comfortable driving and navigating. Overall, I think our session together went really smoothly.
